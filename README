jquery.touchy.js
===========================


Touchy is a jQuery plugin for managing touch and gesture events.  It creates new custom events that a programmer may utilize at a high level, such as "touchy-pinch" and "touchy-rotate" among others, and thus avoid the low-level work of combining touch and gesture events to achieve these common gestural controls.
